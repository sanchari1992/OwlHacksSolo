# Philly CrimeScape: A MATLAB Story

## Elevator Pitch

Unlock hidden insights into Philadelphia's crime data with MATLAB! My project showcases MATLAB's untapped potential in crime data visualization, offering fresh perspectives and innovative insights.

## Steps to Run

1. Unzip the file phillyCrime.csv.zip to get the csv file phillyCrime.csv in the same folder location as the rest of the repo.

2. Run the Matlab program main.m on Matlab.

## Inspiration


Since my journey began at Temple University in Philadelphia, safety has always been the word of mention by my family, my professors, and my friends - basically everyone around me. Despite these, my deep affection for Philadelphia, with its vibrant murals and unique character, has only grown stronger.So, as soon as the tracks for the hackathon were announced, I knew I had to pick "Philly Special".

As for my choice of MATLAB, it's a tool I first encountered in 2010, and though I haven't used it extensively since then, its versatility and sheer potential have always captivated me. Now, I'm excited to harness the power of MATLAB to address a critical issue and make a positive impact in our community.

## What it does

My project addresses the concerning surge in crime rates in Philadelphia, a particularly pertinent issue for Temple University students who regularly receive safety alerts. To effectively combat this rising trend, comprehensive information is crucial. Recognizing that visuals convey information more effectively, my project takes a comprehensive dataset of Philadelphia crime activities, applies rigorous data cleaning techniques to refine and prepare the data, and subsequently employs MATLAB as the primary tool for insightful data visualization. The aim is not only to present crucial information but also to demonstrate the formidable capabilities of MATLAB, extending its prowess beyond traditional statistical operations. This project offers a compelling narrative by showcasing how MATLAB can be a powerful and versatile choice for data analysis and visualization, particularly in a domain dominated by other tools like Pandas in Python.

## How I built it

Back in 2010, I had my first taste of MATLAB during a single semester, leaving a lasting impression of its remarkable versatility. Since then, I've eagerly awaited an opportunity to revisit it. For this project, I scoured numerous datasets until I uncovered the ideal gem within Open Data Philly's public safety information datasets—an extensive Crime Incidents dataset comprising 1,360,635 records. Leveraging MATLAB, I meticulously performed comprehensive data cleansing and preprocessing. In contrast to the more widespread use of Pandas, MATLAB's commands, in my eyes, offer enhanced readability and structured workflows. I then embarked on a journey of visualization, dissecting crime rates by year, exploring monthly trends, and categorizing crime activities. Furthermore, I charted some of the most crime-prone locations onto a geo-map for added context. Looking forward, given more time, my ambitions extend to the realm of predictive analytics, where linear regression models (or other fitting methodologies) could foresee future crime rate escalations in the absence of proactive measures.


## Challenges I ran into

The most prominent challenge I encountered revolved around the availability of learning resources. While there's a wealth of reference materials for data mining with Python, MATLAB lacks a similarly abundant set of resources in specific data mining areas. Consequently, I had to embark on the exhilarating yet demanding journey of coding the entire project from the ground up. At times, I yearned for a collaborative brainstorming partner and an extra set of eyes, but the lack of available team members left me to tackle the project solo. As a first-time hackathon participant, I would have preferred the support of a team. From a technical perspective, I also grappled with GitHub's file size limitations, which necessitated compressing my dataset for users to unzip—whereas I would have preferred a more seamless "plug-and-play" approach.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Participating in my inaugural hackathon, I come from a non-software background with coursework rooted in networks and protocols. Venturing into the realm of data mining presented a personal challenge, yet a rewarding one. Overcoming uncertainties and diving into implementing data mining and visualizations with MATLAB felt like a significant achievement. Throughout the past 24 hours, I tackled challenges, both major and minor, through self-guided learning. This project and hackathon experience have unveiled my strengths in core programming, an uncharted territory until now. Witnessing my program successfully execute its intended tasks fills me with pride. Knowing it has the potential to greatly benefit my neighborhood and extend its impact to other communities amplifies this sense of accomplishment.

## What I learned

This hackathon has been a profound learning experience for me. It has illuminated the fact that we possess the ability to devise solutions for the issues that surround us, regardless of their scale. I've come to understand that the true potential of someone or something remains hidden until given an opportunity to shine. I've gained insights into the importance of crafting a well-thought-out plan, diligently following it, while remaining open to adjustments when unexpected challenges arise. My unwavering commitment to addressing the core problem and contributing to societal betterment has been reinforced. Above all, I've discovered a deep affection for Philadelphia and a profound willingness to actively engage in addressing its challenges, even if it means making a modest yet meaningful impact.
